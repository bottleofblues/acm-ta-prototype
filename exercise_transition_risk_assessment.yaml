title: Transition Risk Assessment
duration_minutes: 4
objective: >
  Orient the learner to the 90-day framework by gauging the relevance and perceived difficulty
  of common transition demands; compute a Transition Risk Index and suggest focus areas.
inputs:
  - name: action
    type: enum
    options:
      - Moving to a new industry or profession
      - Joining a new company
      - Moving to a new unit or group in the same company
      - Being promoted to a higher level
      - Leading former peers (assuming you have been promoted)
      - Moving from one function to another (e.g., sales to marketing)
      - Taking on a cross-functional leadership role for the first time
      - Moving geographically
      - Entering a new national or ethnic culture

      - Entering an organization in which major change already is going on
  - name: relevance
    type: boolean
    label: Is this relevant to your current transition?
  - name: relative_difficulty
    type: integer
    min: 1
    max: 10
    label: If relevant, how difficult (1–10)?

scoring:
  method: sum_difficulties_if_relevant
  output_field: transition_risk_index
  interpretation_buckets:
    - label: Low
      max: 30
      guidance: "Risks appear manageable; prioritize quick wins and stakeholder mapping."
    - label: Moderate
      max: 60
      guidance: "Target 2–3 risk clusters; time-box learning and secure early allies."
    - label: High
      max: 120
      guidance: "Sequence learning, limit scope, and tighten check-ins with sponsor."
next_steps:
  - "Invite learner to journal key concerns (voice or text)."
  - "Recommend reading segments and templates aligned to their highest risk areas."
  - "Schedule a short plan review with coach or sponsor."
